Once LightDM is installed, you will need to configure it.

1. Set the greeter to use:
     Edit the LightDM configuration file:
       /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

       Un-comment the line:
         #greeter-session=example-gtk-gnome

       Replace "example-gtk-gnome" with the greeter you wish to use.

       Examples:
         lightdm-gtk-greeter
         lightdm-mini-greeter
         lightdm-qt5-greeter
         slick-greeter

2. Let LightDM handle the sessions properly:
     Remove all of the following files for each user:
       ~/.xinitrc
       ~/.xsession

     NOTE: If you have or do run xwmconfig LightDM will only load that
           session, even when a different session is selected. Remove
           these files again to fix.
